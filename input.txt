Where did we come from? 
Why are we here? 
Where do we go when we die? 
What lies beyond 
And what lay before? 
Is anything certain in life? 
They say, Life is too short 
The here and the now 
And You are only given one shot 
But could there be more 
Have I lived before 
Or could this be all that we have got? 
If I die tomorrow 
I would be all right 
Because I believe 
That after we're gone 
The spirit carries on 
I used to be frightened of dying 
I used to think death was the end 
But that was before 
I am not scared anymore 
I know that my soul will transcend 
I may never find all the answers 
I may never understand why 
I may never prove 
What I know to be true 
But I know that I still have to try 
If I die tomorrow 
I'd be alright 
Because I believe 
That after we're gone 
The spirit carries on
